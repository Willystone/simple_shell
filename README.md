Compilation
Your shell will be compiled this way:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh 

# Testing
The shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$

#Requirements
simple_shell is designed to run in the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS linux environment and to be compiled using the GNU compiler collection v. gcc 4.8.4 with flags-Wall, -Werror, -Wextra, and -pedantic.

# Installation
Clone this repository: git clone "https://github.com/Willystone/simple_shell.git"
Change directories into the repository: cd simple_shell
Compile: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
Run the shell in interactive mode: ./hsh
Or run the shell in non-interactive mode: example echo "pwd" | ./hsh

# Bugs
At this time, there are no known bugs.
